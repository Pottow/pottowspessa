      <h2>Master's Thesis - University of Birmingham</h2>

      <p>
        My thesis was a driving simulation experiment made in Unity. It tested time-to-collision (TTC) theories and
        steering laws, when approaching gates of variable width.
        The time it took each participant to complete the course was modelled using Accot and Zhai's Steering Law. The
        changing angle between the left gatepost,
        the driver's eyeline, and the right gatepost at each instant was used as input for David Lee's TTC theory.
      </p>

      <p>
        The trial consisted of a total of fourty four very similar levels. The driver had to navigate an unruly car
        through a straight track.
        The levels could be seperated into three types, no obstacles, one gate, and five gates. To create different
        variations on these three
        level types, the width of the track and gates were altered randomly in width.
      </p>

      <p>
        The speed, time, braking, and visual angle to the gate, at each instant, was recorded for each participant. This
        data allowed us to compare how similar
        linear tracks could yield different travel times, despite having equivalent difficulty values according to the
        Steering Law.
      </p>

      <a
        href=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22149996_A_Theory_of_Visual_Control_of_Braking_Based_on_Information_about_Time-to-Collision>
        <img id="TTCTheoryEyeball" src="images/TTCTheory.png">
      </a>

      <p>
        The TTC section of the experiment
        used the visual angle between the driver and the gates to assess whether people react to a gate or opening in
        the same way that they would react to being on
        a collision course with a physical obstacle. The aim was to analyse whether their braking pattern when
        approaching the gate was comparable to the expected
        approach towards a physical obstacle like a wall.

      <h2>Discord Music Bot</h2>

      <p>
        Botress is a bot for playing music over voice chat on Discord. It was coded in Python using the discord.py API
        for integration with Discord. The bot is
        controlled via a GUI on the host's computer. Playlists/genres can be selected from a directory and played on
        shuffle.

      <h2>Random Name Generator</h2>

      <p>
        RandomCimNames is a unique name generator, coded in Go. Rather than using existing names, it instead creates a
        name and surname by applying an
        onomastic ruleset to words imported from a dictionary.

        Example names include:
