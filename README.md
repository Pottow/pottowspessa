# Pottow's Pessa

Currently the site is significantly outdated in terms of the portfolio and underlying code. So it will be changing frequently as it is updated.

A test website on gitPages:
https://pottow.github.io/pottowspessa/


The initial idea behind this project was to create a minimal site from base principles. The codebase uses basic CCS, HTML, and Javascript without an overarching framework like React, Vue, or Angular.

It also acts as a means of keeping track of casual independent projects in a portfolio.
